### Features:

- Multi user Kuma api ( without privilege YET!!) with a small SQLite db
- Easy to use REST API with most of the Uptime-Kuma features
- Swagger Docs
- Dockerized [UptimeKuma_RestAPI Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/medaziz11/uptimekuma_restapi)
- Multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64)

### Example :

You can simply create a docker compose file like this :

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  kuma:
    container_name: uptime-kuma
    image: louislam/uptime-kuma:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - uptime-kuma:/app/data

  api:
    container_name: backend
    image: medaziz11/uptimekuma_restapi
    volumes:
      - api:/db
    restart: always
    environment:
      - KUMA_SERVER=http://kuma:3001
      - KUMA_USERNAME=test
      - KUMA_PASSWORD=123test.
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
    depends_on:
      - kuma
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

volumes:
  uptime-kuma:
  api:
```

### In order for the example to work: You have to run kuma first then create your kuma username and password then re-run the compose file.
